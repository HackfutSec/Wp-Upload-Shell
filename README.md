What it does:
Exploits a file upload vulnerability in the plugin to upload a malicious PHP shell (spec.ph p).

Checks if the upload was successful and verifies shell access.

Saves successfully hacked sites in shells.txt.

How it works:
Takes a list of target websites from a text file (sites.txt).

Attempts to upload a disguised PHP shell (hidden as a fake GIF).

If successful, the attacker gains remote code execution (RCE) on the vulnerable site.
